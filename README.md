   How can topic modelling techniques be applied to understand the themes and discussions in Reddit communities? 

   
Progress Of the Project:

Did come across the reddit scrapper tool which acrapes the data of a subreddit by using the url of the post of the reddit

In this the extraction of number of replies to the comments of the post can be modified

The link of the reddit data tool is https://github.com/NFeruch/reddit2text.git

This helps to extract the data from the reddit to a text file


For the topic modelling we did use BERTopic modelling and for this we have taken reference from this code :
https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/topicsovertime/topicsovertime.html

From the above code we did modify the code so that it would be suitable for the scope of this project.
