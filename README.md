   How can topic modelling techniques be applied to understand the themes and discussions in Reddit communities? 

   
Progress Of the Project:

- Did create a developer Reddit to access its API to extract the data
- Created a supabase account to write the SQL code related to the project

  Found a GitHub repository which deals with the extraction of Reddit data
  The Reddit link is https://github.com/socius-org/RedditHarbor.git

  From here have taken the code and will now modify the code according to the project to collect data
